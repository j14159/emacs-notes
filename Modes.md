# ace-jump

Can't function without this anymore.  C-c SPC to pick a word to jump to based on its starting character.

# cua-mode

Currently only using this for the block editing.  C-Ret lets me highlight and manipulate a block of space/text.  E.g.

* increase/decrease leading whitespace in a block
* add/change a prefix in a block

# occur

Only just learned about this.  Regex search term for the current buffer, brings up lines that match in the \*Occur\* buffer which lets you jump to individual occurences.

# magit
